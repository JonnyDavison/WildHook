## Responsive Layout and Design
The WildHook website features a responsive layout and design, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Leveraging the power of Bootstrap 5 framework, the website effortlessly adapts to different viewport dimensions, providing seamless navigation and content accessibility.

Bootstrap 5, renowned for its robust grid system and mobile-first approach, forms the foundation of the website's responsive design. By incorporating responsive utility classes and components offered by Bootstrap, the website dynamically adjusts its layout and content presentation to suit the viewing environment.

While Bootstrap 5 handles the bulk of the responsive design requirements, additional customizations and fine-tuning have been implemented through carefully crafted media queries. These media queries target specific breakpoints and device widths, allowing for precise control over element positioning, typography, and visual styling.

Key features of the responsive layout include:

- Fluid Grid System: The website's layout is based on a fluid grid system, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment of content elements across devices.
- Flexible Components: Bootstrap 5 components such as navigation bars, cards, and forms automatically adjust their size and alignment to fit smaller screens without compromising usability.
- Mobile-First Approach: Following the mobile-first paradigm, the website prioritizes the mobile viewing experience, ensuring that content is accessible and readable on smartphones and tablets.
- Breakpoint Optimization: Media queries are strategically used to optimize the layout at different breakpoints, ensuring that content is displayed optimally on devices ranging from small smartphones to large desktop monitors.
- Touch-Friendly Interactions: Interactive elements such as buttons, links, and menus are optimized for touch input, enhancing usability on touchscreen devices.
- Image Optimization: Images are optimized for various resolutions and screen sizes, striking a balance between visual quality and page loading performance.
- Accessibility Considerations: Efforts have been made to ensure that the website complies with accessibility standards, making it usable for users with disabilities and assistive technologies.

Overall, the responsive layout and design of the WildHook website contribute to a seamless and engaging user experience, regardless of the device or platform used for access. By embracing responsive web design principles and leveraging modern frontend technologies, the website delivers a visually appealing and accessible interface that meets the diverse needs of users in today's digital landscape.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Heroku
#### Project Deployment: Heroku

#### 1. Initial Setup on Heroku:
<br>
  Sign up or log in to Heroku.
  On the main Heroku Dashboard, click 'New' > 'Create New App'.
  Name your project (e.g., mont-adventures-pp5). Remember, the app name must be unique.
  Choose a suitable region and then click 'Create app'.

#### 2. Setting Up the Database:
<br>
Navigate to the 'Resources' tab from the submenu.
In the 'Add-ons' section, search for 'Heroku Postgres'.
Select and add 'Heroku Postgres' as the database.
Go to the 'Settings' tab, and within the 'Config Vars' section, copy the DATABASE_URL for later use.

#### 3. Configuring Django App for Heroku:
<br>
Create a .env file at the root of your Django project.

- DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url_from_heroku>
- SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
- USE_AWS=<True>
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_key_id>
- AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your_bucket_name>
- AWS_REGION_NAME=<your_region_name>
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key_id>
- DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your_default_from_email_name>
- EMAIL_HOST_PASS=<your_email_host_pass>
- EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your_email_host_user>
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_stripe_public_key>
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET=<your_stripe_wh_secret>

Additionally you must add these variables to the Heroku under 'Config Vars'.

Modify `settings.py` in your Django app:

- Import dotenv and load .env with dotenv.load_dotenv().
- Replace the default secret key with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY').
- Update the databases section to connect to the Heroku Postgres: DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}.

<br>

#### 4. Setting Up AWS S3:
- Visit AWS S3 and either sign in or create an account.
- Create a new S3 bucket and note down the necessary configurations like AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL and AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME.
- Add these configurations to your .env file.
- Add these variables to Heroku 'Config Vars'.
- Modify settings.py to configure AWS S3:
- Add AWS configurations for static and media files.

#### 5. Final Configurations:
Link your templates directory in Heroku: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates').
Update the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR: 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR].
Add your Heroku app to ALLOWED_HOSTS (format: app_name.herokuapp.com).
Create three top-level directories in your project: media, static, templates.
Add a Procfile at the top level and write: web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi.
Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

#### 6. Deploy on Heroku:
In Heroku, go to the 'Deploy' tab.
Deploy the branch manually and monitor the build logs for any issues.
Once the build completes, you'll see a success message and a link to view the live site.
Note: Replace placeholders like <your_database_url_from_heroku>, <your_secret_key>, <PROJECT_NAME> with actual values relevant to your project.
